 #This line creates a list __all__ that includes the names of all global variables and functions in the current module's namespace, except those that are in _EXCLUDE or those that start with an underscore (_), which are typically considered private.
 #The __all__ list defines the public API of the module, specifying which components should be accessible when the module is imported using from module import *.
